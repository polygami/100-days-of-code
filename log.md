# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 25, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Got things set up by:
- Creating a markdown code snippet in Visual Studio Code, to quickly add log entries.
- Setting up a repository on my GitHub account which will contain all of my work over the next 100 days.

**Thoughts:** I *really* didn't do all that much tangible today, but I put everything in place to start tomorrow, when I want to continue creating a decent looking website to show my work (and progress) on GitHub.

### Day 1: April 27, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Today I added some basic CSS for the header, footer and link cards. I also added some additional HTML to show the first 50 days.

**Thoughts:** I got off to a good start today, but I am having a bit of trouble with positioning the text within the cards. It seems to have extra padding and I'm not sure if this is an issue caused by Flexbox or not. Tomorrow I will try and fix it.
