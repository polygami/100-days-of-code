# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 25, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Got things set up by:
- Creating a markdown code snippet in Visual Studio Code, to quickly add log entries.
- Setting up a repository on my GitHub account which will contain all of my work over the next 100 days.

**Thoughts:** I *really* didn't do all that much tangible today, but I put everything in place to start tomorrow, when I want to continue creating a decent looking website to show my work (and progress) on GitHub.

### Day 1: April 27, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Today I added some basic CSS for the header, footer and link cards. I also added some additional HTML to show the first 50 days.

**Thoughts:** I got off to a good start today, but I am having a bit of trouble with positioning the text within the cards. It seems to have extra padding and I'm not sure if this is an issue caused by Flexbox or not. Tomorrow I will try and fix it.

### Day 2: April 28, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I spent a good few hours today adding some CSS transitions to each of the cards in my page. I also added a JavaScript file, to add a placeholder image to incomplete days and place a day-specific thumbnail to each completed day, based on a naming convention. Lastly, I added the rest of the 100 cards, and added some text at the top of the page, explaining the challenge and the projects.

**Thoughts:** I am happy with the hover effects that I added. I'm still not 100% happy with the design of the page, but I guess that boils down to developing before designing. I also still need to refresh myself on how Flexbox works, so that my card subheadings look better. For now I have removed them, though.

### Day 3: April 29, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Today I improved the styling of my intro text, fixed the spacing issues between my card headings and subheadings, and added an animated progress bar, which animates to the value set in the `completedDays` variable.

In addition, I also completed 46 items on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/fcc10c47b53-d9c5-4677-b26b-28b2d960a55b).

**Thoughts:** I got a surprising amount done this evening. I looked back on my notes from yesterday, and used that to form a plan of what to focus on today. I much prefer how my page looks now, with the altered pallette, and clear separation between sections, in stands out much more.

I don't want to dwell on the page for that long, as it is meant to be a place to hold my work, not the work itself.

In my free slots, I worked my way through 46 items on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/fcc10c47b53-d9c5-4677-b26b-28b2d960a55b), and am finding them pretty simple so far. I did complete Colt Steele's [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) though, so I am familiar, and comfortable with the majority of the material. In any case, it is good to refresh my memory and work towards getting those certificates!

### Day 4: May 1, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to work on my CSS skills. I started to create Eric Cartman from South Park in pure CSS.

**Thoughts:** It's surprisingly difficult to make rudimentary shapes with CSS. I realised that my skills in CSS shapes and positioning weren't that great, and decided to spend 3 days doing a "simple" CSS project. I assumed that making a South Park character would be straight forward, but when dealing with percentiles as a unit of measurement, it can be quite difficult to fathom. My main takeaways today were:
- Use classes for general properties
- Use IDs for specific properties
- If a shape doesn't look right, check that height and width aren't mixed up!

### Day 5: May 2, 2019
**Today's Progress**: Today I gained a better understanding of how absolute and relative positioning works and learned a few tricks on how to make irregular shapes (like Cartman's right glove). I tried to do as much as I could with `transformation` and `border-radius` alone, but some things required `clip-path` (which felt a bit like cheating), but I couldn't see a better way without using SVG. Most important though, I finished in 2 days instead of 3, as I have initial anticipated!

**Thoughts:** It is interesting trying to think about how to break shapes into basic forms and translate a visual reference into code. There *were* a few times where I used [Clippy](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/), which was massively helpful, but there were a few parts where I manually added the points along the path using only estimation, trial and error. It is obviously a very ineffecient way of doing things, but it served its purpose as a personal challenge.

### Day 6: May 4, 2019
**Today's Progress**: I completely redesigned my 100DoC page. Before, I had just gone in and started coding, but I wanted to put more time into properly designing the layout.

After completing the redesign, I *began* coding it and reacquainting myself with Flexbox and built a nav bar.

**Thoughts:** In terms of how much I *coded* today, it doesn't *appear* to be much. Although, I did take a few hours in Photoshop, doing some design work, I actually did a fair bit of coding as well. I have used flexbox in the past, but I'd kind of forgotten how it all works. I spent time (re)reading through the [CSS Tricks Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and used my recovered knowledge to build a simple nav bar, using my design as a reference. There is a lot of space to fill on the new page, but with my PSD as a guide, and my improved understanding of CSS, I think I can finish the page tomorrow.
